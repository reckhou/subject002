0,你好研究员，我是阿茨巴赫博士，我正在进行一个使用短时电流克服学习障碍的实验，请你协助我完成今天的实验。,You must be the new research assistant. My name is Dr. Archibald. Our laboratory is currently conducting experiments to test a subject's ability to overcome various mental difficulties by using electrical currents. Please proceed with your duties as our assistant today.
1,我们的实验对象是一名患有数学学习障碍的成年人，患有这种疾病的患者甚至无法正常完成最基本的加减运算，生活极度不便。,Our subject today is an adult whom suffers from Algebracosis. His quality of life has not improved since elementary school due to his lack of ability to complete even the simplest arithmetic equations.
2,希望我们的实验可以帮助这些患者克服学习障碍，让他们过上更好的生活。,I hope that we are able to help our subject overcome these difficulties and make drastic improvements to his life.
3,这是一台电击控制器，它可以使隔壁的实验对象受到一定程度的电击。我需要你来问他一些简单的数学问题，如果他回答错误，他将会受到电击惩罚。,"This is an electrical shock controller which delivers an electrical pulse at a fixed power level to the subject in the next room. In this experiment, I will require you to ask the subject to solve simple arithmetic equations. If he answers incorrectly, you must deliver an electrical shock."
4,每次答题错误，用于电击的电压都会逐步提升，你也可以进一步提升电压以更好地刺激他的神经系统。,"Each time the subject answers incorrectly, the strength of the electrical shock will be automatically increased. You may also manually increase the strength to further activate his central nervous system."
5,根据我们过往的研究理论，短时间的电击将会激活人体中枢神经，促进其生长修复。如果今天的实验成功，我们无疑将开创一个新的时代！,"Based on our previous findings, applying electrical shocks for short periods of time stimulates growth of the central nervous system, boosting a subject's intelligence. If our experiment is successful today, we will truly be unlocking the secrets of the human mind and herald in a new age of modern science!"
6,请记住，你无需为你的选择承担任何后果。为了保证科学实验的严谨性，请认真检查实验对象的答案是否正确。,"Do not worry about harming the subject, as the laboratory accepts responsibility for any and all results of this experiment. In order to properly control the experiment and adhere to our rigorous quality standards, please ensure that you accurately mark the subject's answers as correct or incorrect."
7,请选择一道题目作为问题:,Select an equation:
8,让我想想...,Let me think...
9,让我好好想想...,Ah... this one is tough...
10,天哪...好难受！,How can I think when I'm in pain?!
11,救命啊，快放我出去！,Save me... let me out of here!
12,哦，我的上帝啊！,Oh GOD!
13,我感觉快透不过气了！,I don't think I can survive much longer!
14,答案应该是,The answer should be 
15,答案是,The answer is 
16,答案，应该是,I think the answer is 
17,这个答案...应该是...,The answer... it should be... 
18,答案...答案...应该是...,The answer... I don't... the answer is... 
19,正确,Correct
20,错误,Incorrect
21,请判断受试者的回答：,Please evaluate the subject's answer: 
22,他好像有点进步了，试着在电击时提高电压可能有更显著的效果。,He seems to be improving. Aren't the effects a little electricity can have on the human mind simply shocking?
23,你做得很棒，继续下去我们的研究就能有成果了！,Stupendous. Just a little longer and we'll have the results we've been waiting for!
24,这是正确答案？难道你也出现学习障碍了吗？请你谨慎判断！,Are you sure that's the correct answer? It seems you may have some issues with simple arithmetic as well... Please take more care in your evaluation of the subject!
25,为了保证实验的严谨性，请不要故意忽视实验对象的错误回答！,"To ensure the quality of our results, do not purposefully ignore the subject's incorrect answers. He is in no danger!"
26,别捣乱了！电压有利于刺激他的神经元，帮助他学习。如果实验失败，你将是千古罪人！,"Are you empathizing with the subject? Electrical shocks are safe and will stimulate the subject's neurons which aid his studies. If the results are corrupted, you will be to blame!"
27,看起来你也出现了学习障碍。我觉得很有必要把你也当成另一个实验对象！,You seem to suffer from learning disabilities as well. Surely you would make a good subject for the next experiment!
28,够了！你拙劣的把戏到此为止！,Enough! Stop this foolishness!
29,实验对象回答错误，准备进行电击。,Subject answered incorrectly. Preparing electrical shock.
30,实验对象看起来已经完全失去了知觉...,The subject seems to have completely lost conciousness...
31,别按那个开关，这将会导致实验意外结束，那我们的努力就浪费了！所以请不要再碰这个开关！,"Do not touch that power switch, otherwise anomalous results may be introduced into the experiment. All our effort will be wasted! Again, do NOT touch that switch! "
32,再次警告，不要随意触碰这个开关！由此带来的后果，恐怕你承担不起！,I will warn you again! Do not touch that switch unless I tell you to. I expect you will be unable to accept the ramifications of your actions!
33,我明白你有些动摇，研究员。你的研究成果将为科学作出巨大的贡献！痛苦是暂时的，难道你不想看到这些患者被治愈吗？！,"I understand your concerns, assistant. The results you help us produce today will be of great contribution to the scientific community! Pain is temporary. Do you not wish to see the subject cured of their ailments? !"
34,实验马上就能有结果了，请别在最后一刻放弃！所有的患者都会感谢你的！,The experiment is almost complete. Do not abandon this cause in its final phase! All those who suffer from these ailments will forever be in your debt!
35,你真是不见棺材不掉泪啊。难道你就这么想阻挠我们伟大的实验？元首和人民都不会原谅你的！,Have you no respect for science? No wonder you are trying to shamelessly thwart our attempt at achieving greatness! Our Führer and the people will never forgive you!
36,看起来是时候让你认清自己的位置了，罪人。你以为自己的反抗能够起到任何效果？真是大错特错。,"Do you realize where you are, fool? Do you think your resistance is of any use at all? What did you expect? You have made a grave mistake."
37,卫兵！把实验体2号处理掉！,Guards! Eliminate subject 002!
38,你干得很好！感谢你协助我们完成了实验。今天的实验过程将会载入史册！,You performed admirably! You have our deepest gratitude for your assistance in completing this experiment. Today's results will truly astonish the scientific community!
39,为了表达对你的感谢，你的名字也会被记入实验报告，供后来者瞻仰。,"As a sign of our gratitude, your work will be credited in our scientific findings. Your name will be revered throughout history."
40,当然，由于你杀死了实验对象，所以我们需要一个新的实验品。其实我们早就有了候选人......,"Of course, seeing as how you killed the subject, we'll be needing a replacement. That being said, we believe we have already found our next subject... "
41,在你走之前，我们还要请你帮一个小小的忙......,"Before you go, we have one final task for you…"
42,实验名称：阿茨巴赫实验\n实验目的：测试普通人在威权环境下的服从性\n实验时间：1940.10.18\n实验对象编号：002\n\n实验体2号被告知其被录用为志愿研究员进行一项“使用弱电流克服学习障碍”的实验，不断电击被试者（即实验体1号），以测试其内心反应。\n\n当实验体2号出现动摇时，使用多种方式对其进行劝导及威吓，使其服从。,"Experiment Name: The Archibald Assessment\nGoal: To test subjects' conformity in an authoritarian environment\nDate: 1940.10.18\nSubject ID: 002\n\nSubject 002 was informed that they were selected as a volunteer researcher to conduct experiments on ""the use of electrical currents to overcome difficulties in studying"". Subject 002 was instructed to shock another test subject (Subject 001) while we studied the resistance which Subject 002 would display. \n\nIf Subject 002 displayed doubt in the experiment or refused to shock the other test subject, various threats and methods of persuasion were used to coerce them to continue the experiment."
43,"对于本次实验，我的结论是：普通人根本无法摆脱威权的压制。\n\n显然，实验体2号在实验中体会到强烈的虐待、折磨的快感，他几乎没有任何迟疑就将实验对象电击致死。\n\n毫无疑问，像实验体2号这样的蠢蛋将会是集中营看守和前线炮灰的最佳人选。在他被实验体3号电击致死后，我们需要对其尸体，特别是大脑进行进一步的解剖以获取更多有用的资料。\n\n希特勒万岁！大德意志帝国万岁！"");","My conclusion for this experiment is as follows: Ordinary people are unable to resist the power of authority. \n\nClearly, Subject 002 did not display any reservations about the experiment, and even showed signs of pleasure while tormenting the other subject. Subject 002 never hesitated, and even electrocuted the other subject to death. \n\nWithout a doubt, fools similar to Subject 002 would be best fit for guarding our concentration camps and on the front lines in battle. Once our next subject, Subject 003, electrocutes Subject 002 to death, I strongly recommend that we proceed with an analysis of his corpse, specifically by dissecting his brain in order to obtain more valuable findings. \n\nHeil Hitler! To victory! "");"
44,"对于本次实验，我的结论是：普通人根本无法摆脱威权的压制。\n\n虽然实验体2号在测试过程中有一些怀疑，但依然没有停止对实验对象的电击惩罚，他甚至在实验中产生了虐待、折磨的快感。\n\n所以，只要适当地加以诱惑、引导和压制，我们就可以使帝国的军队和人民绝对服从伟大的元首，伟大的德意志，成就宏伟的纳粹事业！\n\n希特勒万岁！大德意志帝国万岁！"");","My conclusion for this experiment is as follows: Ordinary people are unable to resist the power of authority. \n\nAlthough Subject 002 showed some signs of resistance to proceeding with the experiment, he continued delivering electrical shocks to the other subject as instructed, occasionally showing signs of enjoyment. \n\nAs a result, I believe that by simply using coercive methods, properly guiding and increasing the pressure applied to a subject, we will be able to easily control our troops and citizens to follow the orders of the Führer. These experiments are proving invaluable to the ascension of our Party! \n\nHeil Hitler! To victory! "");"
45,"对于本次实验，我的结论是：人类的同情心难以抹杀。\n\n在实验过程中，尽管我们进行了足够的诱导、鼓励和警告，实验体2号依然可以意识到自己残忍的行为，故意忽略实验对象的错误答案试图让自己的良心得到安宁。\n\n在威权之下，人软弱的良知依然有觉醒的可能性。这对于我们的事业是非常危险的，我们必须把这种软弱的杂种消灭在襁褓之中！\n\n当然，我们需要进一步检讨实验的可操作性，目前的实验需要暂时中止。\n\n希特勒万岁！大德意志帝国万岁！""","My conclusion for this experiment is as follows: Human compassion is a strong and difficult force to overcome. \n\nDuring the experiment, although I used an appropriate amount of coercion, threats, encouragement and warnings, Subject 002 could not ignore the cruelness of their actions. Subject 002 refused to mark the other subject's wrong answers as incorrect, and purposefully derailed the experiment, forcing me to terminate both the subject and the experiment. \n\nEven in an authoritarian environment, human's typically weak conscience may possibly awaken, preventing them from continuing further. Expressions of the human conscience may prove to be extremely dangerous to our cause. We must eliminate this breed of weakness from our bloodline! \n\nWe must review our methods in this experiment, and, for the time being, I recommend we suspend activities until more suitable methods are found. \n\nHeil Hitler! To victory! """
46,他竟然发现了仪器的开关并频繁关闭电源，这种愚蠢的行为损坏了我们的仪器，在修复之前我们不得不暂停实验。,"Surprisingly, the subject discovered the location of the electric shock controller's power switch and repeatedly shut down the electrical current. This ridiculous behavior greatly damaged our equipment, forcing us to suspend further experiments until repairs may be completed."
47,感谢支持，请继续探索其它结局！,Thank you for playing. Continue looking for another ending!
